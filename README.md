# Palindrome Checker

A lightweight JavaScript function that determines if a string reads the same forwards and backwards.  
Built as part of my *JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures* certification practice.

Youâ€™re welcome to reuse or modify the code, but I recommend implementing your own solution to better internalize the concept.

Keep coding and exploring!
